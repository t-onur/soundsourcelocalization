Automatic Camera Directing using Sound Source Localization

In this thesis, Time Difference of Arrival method has been used in order to find sound source's estimated location. To visualize the location, Sony's EVI-D31V camera, which can be controlled over VISCA Protocol, is used to be rotated towards the sound source automatically.

Source code and my final thesis report of this project can be found in files.
